The FRL Project stands for "Forensic-Ready Logger". 
It is a scientific approach that elicits a set of potential software misuse scenarios, expressed as annotated UML Sequence Diagrams. 
These UML Sequence Diagrams can then be used to identify the exact location where logging instructions should be placed and the information they should log.

To use our FRL approach, please visit the Instructions.pdf file
