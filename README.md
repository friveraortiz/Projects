Welcome to our Repository.
This repository contains the applications that I have develop in collaboration with my supervisor during my Ph.D. in Computer Science.

The project FRL stands for "Forensic-Ready Logger".
This is our proposed scientific approach that elicits a set of potential software misuse scenarios, expressed as annotated UML sequence diagrams.
First, visit this project. 
Inside this project, go the Incident Model Version branch.
Then, visit the README.md File.
Finally, visit the FRL_IM_Instructions.pdf File.

The HRM project stands for "Human Resources Management" software system.
This is a software system that we used to showcase our Forensic-Ready Logger approach. 
The HRM software system supports the submission and approval of travel requests. 
Once you have installed and executed the FRL approach first, go to the HRM branch.
Then, visit the README.md File.
Finally, visit the HRM_Instructions.pdf File.
