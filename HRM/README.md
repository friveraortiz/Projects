The HRM Project stands for "Human Resources Management Software System".
This software system supports the submission and approval of travel requests. 
It includes three main modules: 
1) Employees: it allows adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing employees; 
2) Users: it allows adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing users of the HRM software system and their credentials; 
3) Travel Requests: it allows creating, modifying, approving, deleting, and viewing travel requests. 

To use our HRM software system, please visit the Instructions_HRM.pdf file.
